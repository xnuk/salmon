> dunno why üêü and üçü become salmon but it generates [chips]' `plugin.yaml` from your `config.fish`

## Requirements
- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
- [chips]

## Install
Copy the [`functions/salmon.fish`](./functions/salmon.fish)
to `~/.config/fish/functions/salmon.fish`:
```
cp functions/salmon.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/salmon.fish
```

Or download it:
```sh
curl --location --create-dirs --output ~/.config/fish/functions/salmon.fish \
  https://cdn.rawgit.com/xnuk/salmon/master/functions/salmon.fish
```

Or you can even download it by chips:
```yaml
# in ~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml:
github:
  - 'xnuk/salmon'
```

After you installed and [configured](#how-does-it-look-like) things,
you'll need to make `~/.config/chips/build.fish` useless.
[Details are explained below.](#make-buildfish-useless)


## How does it look like?
Before you configure, PLEASE backup your `~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml`,
or it'll overwrite it:
```sh
cp ~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml ~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml.backup
```

On your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
```fish
# This script overwrites ~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml
# If you don't want it, uncomment the following line:
# set -g SALMON_NO_OVERWRITE

if salmon
  # Collecting github repos
  set -g chips_github_repos ''

  # ------ Configuration START ------

  # Install plugin from repository
  salmon 'username/repo'

  # Or plugin in sub-directory
  salmon 'username/repo/shellscript'

  # Or single fish script in repository
  salmon 'username/repo/shellscript/activate.fish'

  # This is a shell script; you can play with logic!
  if [ $TERM = 'linux' ]
    salmon 'oh-my-fish/theme-nai'
  else
    salmon 'xtendo-org/tartar'
  end

  # ------ Configuration END ------

  # NOTE: This command will overwrite ~/.config/chips/plugin.yaml
  salmon
end

# Triggers if salmon finds the plugins which is not installed yet.
if set -q chips_should_update
  chips
end
```
## Make `build.fish` useless
After you installed and [configured](#how-does-it-look-like) things,
you'll need to make `~/.config/chips/build.fish` useless.
Or [chips] eagerly tries to source `build.fish` and because of that,
salmon is not going to work properly.

There's 2 different ways to achieve, pick one:

### The "I like `rm`" way
In `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, find the line starts with `function chips;`,
and insert `rm ~/.config/chips/build.fish;` right before the `exec fish`.

```fish
# Before:
function chips; "/home/xnuk/.local/bin/chips" $argv; exec fish; end

# After:
function chips; "/home/xnuk/.local/bin/chips" $argv; rm ~/.config/chips/build.fish; exec fish; end
```

### The "I like file permission" way
Make `~/.config/chips/build.fish` to empty file,
and restrict write permission of it.

After this, [chips] would return non-successful exit code, and
[seems like it disables self-update feature.](https://github.com/xtendo-org/chips/blob/master/src/Lib.hs#L106)
But don't worry; [they don't make release often.](https://github.com/xtendo-org/chips/releases)

```fish
rm ~/.config/chips/build.fish
touch ~/.config/chips/build.fish
chmod a-w ~/.config/chips/build.fish
```
